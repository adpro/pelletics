A tool to compare the use of pellets in recent years and other statistics.

:warning: **THIS IS UNFINISHED DRAFT OF INITIAL VERSION OF PROJECT README** :warning:

## Future tool purpose
The application will calculate statistics based on historical data on the number of burned pellets:
- number of kg of pellets burned for each month of the year
- comparison of burned kg of pellets in individual years by months (trend)
- the amount of ash produced by burning pellets in each month
- costs of fuel burned in individual months
- current number of kg of pellets in stock
- prediction of the date of emptying the pellets based on their use in the current year and the trend of previous years
- and more...
